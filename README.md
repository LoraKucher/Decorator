# Swift Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns provide solutions to common software design problems. In the case of object-oriented programming, design patterns are generally aimed at solving the problems of object generation and interaction, rather than the larger scale problems of overall software architecture. They give generalised solutions in the form of templates that may be applied to real-world problems.

### Why do you need to know the patterns?

- The main reason is that patterns simplify the design and support of programs.

- Proven solutions.

- When you use ready-made solutions, instead of reinventing the wheel.

- Code standardization.

- You make fewer mistakes, so you find all the hidden problems.

- Mutual language.

You pronounce the name of the pattern, instead of explaining it to the other teams.

### P.S. Each branch corresponds to a pattern
